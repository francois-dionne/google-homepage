This is my Google homepage project (french version) from The Odin Project Foundations Course.

I did not commit very often, but I have been working on this project for a while. I wanted the end result to be very close to the actual google homepage. Since I'm from Montreal (Canada), I built the page in french.

I took some other courses to learn flexbox, it was my main challenge for this project.
